# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* For this challenge I used https://developers.themoviedb.org API, This API gives access to millions of movies and TV shows

* I completed the following

* Created a rails api using --api flag
* Database contains Search model to record searches also each search needs to be unique, if a search has been done before, the search will return an error message saying "Search has already been used".
* Ability to use filters on the search
* You can create new movies to store locally
* You can delete the movies you create
* You can edit the movies you create

* curl 'http://localhost:3000/searches?search=win&sort=true'

* Ensure the uniqueness of the search is true or else return message



* Spec tests to confirm the API is successful
